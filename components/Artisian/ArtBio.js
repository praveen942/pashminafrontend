          The glory that an embroidered Pashmina enjoyed in the past wasn&apos;t at
          all overhyped. It was worth even more. After all, what is not to love.
          Producing the raw wool for Pashmina takes the Ladakhi goat to tolerate
          a temperature of -50 degrees before it grows Pashm. Next, it takes
          professionals and herders together to gently comb the same wool off
          the goat&apos;s body. This raw wool reaches Kashmir and is sorted by
          womenfolk which takes careful attention to every single thread which
          is below 16 microns in diameter. This finest of the fine threads is
          handspun over a charkha (Yinder) by women with their bare hands. These
          threads are barely visible to a common man who doesn&apos;t know the art.
          Later the threads are handed over to weavers, who weave the threads
          into the fabric over a handloom, which is again mostly manual with a
          little help from the machine. The shawl, stole, or scarf thus obtained
          is sent for embroidery, where the embroidery artisan casts a magical
          spell over the shawl. With such finesse and intricacy, he embellishes
          the airy light and gentle shawl with traditional embroidery patterns.
          Embroidering a Pashmina needs full attention, great skill and years of
          experience to master One such embroidery artisan is Gulam Azeem
          Sheikh. Sheikh was studying in class 10th when his parents passed away
          in an accident while coming back from Jammu, where they went for an
          exhibition. Sheikh&apos;s father was an embroidery artisan himself and he
          had taken some of his masterpieces to show in an exhibition where
          people from Europe were expected to come. But on the way back, their
          bus collided with another and caused a heavy loss of lives. Sheikh was
          left with a little amount of savings and 3 sisters to take care of.
          Luckily Sheikh had learnt embroidery from his father and used to help
          him whenever his father would not be well. He knew much more than the
          basics and was gifted with a sense of creativity. He always argued
          with his father when he saw the same motifs over shawls &quot;Abba, let&apos;s
          embroider it in another way, another pattern&quot; he used to ask his dad
          who would laugh at how little Sheikh didn&apos;t understand the speciality
          of traditional motifs. Sheikh would then draw those motifs on a paper
          with ink and save it in a steel trunk. After his father&apos;s death,
          Sheikh had to leave studies, and continue embroidering shawls, which
          he acquired from the owners of power looms. &quot;Machine-made shawls and
          handmade shawls are two different things&quot;, Sheikh sorrowfully
          explained to us. &quot;Handmade has a totally different feel&quot;. The owner of
          a power loom had employed Sheikh and his friends who worked on meagre
          income in a matchbox-sized room. They hand-embroidered shawls and
          scarves and the owner paid them at the completion of a shawl, an
          amount, which when distributed between the employees wouldn&apos;t be
          enough for a month even.

          On our first visit to Kashmir, we saw Sheikh purchasing thread from a
          local supplier. We asked him the address of another artisan, who had
          the same story. But being the smart young man, that he had been famous
          for since childhood, he asked us why we were looking for a Pashmina
          artisan, and we sat in a garden nearby to discuss with him our
          business model. When Sheikh narrated his story, we welcomed him into
          Pashmina.com and sent him to seek permission from the owner of his
          factory. After getting the permission, Sheikh was so overwhelmed that
          he left the purchased threads in the local park and forgot to hand it
          over to the factory owner. Today Sheikh and Pashmina.com work together
          and it has been 4 years since that afternoon. Shiekh gets monthly
          wages and not product-wise wages. He feels that he is finally getting
          what he deserved. He has even shown us his childhood sketches which we
          introduced in our modern design Pashminas.
