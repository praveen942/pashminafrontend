          Pashmina is considered the finest craftsmanship in the world which
          transforms the exceptionally warm and delicate Cashmere threads to
          opulent accessories. The fleece of Changthangi Goat is known as Pashm
          which is an Urdu word & has origins in Farsi. This goat is exotic and
          is only found there, 15000 feet above sea level in Ladakh - Jammu and
          Kashmir, making the art of Pashmina even rarer and revered all over
          the world. Pashmina has fascinated kings, royals, and people all over
          the world by its magical allure and a traditional grace. Perhaps this
          was the reason why we chose to showcase the exquisiteness and regal
          demeanour of this centuries old art to the world

            aesthetics of this art spread more and French monarch Napoleon
            Bonaparte gifted his wife, Josephine, a Pashmina shawl. She is
            believed to have owned a few hundred shawls in that time. In Iran,

          <p>
            Changthang is the land of the nomads, located east of Leh, about
            14600 m above sea level. The area is untouched, unusual and rare. It
            seems as if the noise and grit of the city fades till it reaches
            Changthang top. Perhaps what makes it so is extreme climate, high
            altitude and remoteness. And since these properties made Changthang
            unsuitable for agriculture, the local nomads started rearing goats -
            the Changthangi goats. For the goats, these conditions are perfect.
            It is these goats which grow Cashmere - the same Cashmere which is
            processed in Kashmir to conceive Pashmina shawls.

          </h2>
          <p>

              What is Kani Shawl?
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            To counter this problem, the kani shawls were woven as per panel
            designs. Then the different parts of the design were stitched
            together to form a cohesive shawl.
          </p>
          <p>
            The “rafugars” stitched the panels together with such precision that
            it was hard to tell where the seams were.
          </p>

            to be made from three years to 6-8 months. But it significantly
            increased the number of looms used &amp; the kani weavers working on
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            One rafugar in particular, known as Ali Baba, had the idea of
            touching up the design &amp; pattern of the kani with thread &amp;
            needle using the chain stitch. He was much pleased with the result
            &amp; proceeded to develop the entire design by embroidery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, he modified it further by using pashmina thread for
            embroidery. This improved the final result of both, the kani &amp;
            the chain stitch.

              Introduction of embroidered shawls
            </h2>
            <p>
              Initially, the embroidery replicated the twill tapestry &amp;
              required very minute observation to tell the difference between
              the two.
            </p>
            <p>
              An embroidered shawl took quarter of the time to be ready compared
              to the kani shawls having a similar body of work. It was hence
              priced much lower than kani shawls. As far as looks were
              concerned, the embroidered shawls were spectacular. The decreased
              time to make an embroidered shawl resulted in considerably less
              taxation than the Kani shawls.
            </p>
            <p>

                kani shawls
              </a>
              , thereby increasing its cost, the embroidered shawls, with
              comparatively lower prices started gaining popularity. These
              embroidered shawls, were known as “
              <a
                className="link text-blue-500"

              ” &amp; originated in the 18th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              For embroidering the shawls, the design to be embroidered on the
              shawl is traced out with perforated lines. It is then imprinted
              onto the shawl using a fine powder in a contrasting color through
              the perforations. Once the tracing was removed, the outlines would
              be visible on the shawl for the embroiderer to start working on.
              These days however, the embroiderers may also use wooden blocks
              with carved out designs to make the tracings on the shawl.

            Embroidery gains fame

          <p>
            The pinnacle of the embroidery was seen in the mid-19th century. It
            was when embroiderers developed a new technique, using which the
            shawl would have two different colors on either side of the shawl.
            These were called

            </a>
            shawls meaning two- colored.
          </p>
          <p>
            The technique implied imitating the kani weave on the wrong side of
            the embroidered shawl. This was done by interlacing a different
            colored thread through the fabric along the motif to mimic kani
            weave.

          <p>
            The making of the do runga shawls is still practiced however; the do
            runga embroideries done with Cashmere yarn have ceased to exist in
            Kashmir after the middle of the 19th century. In fact, this term is
            not recognized in Kashmir in the present day.

              4. What all types of Pashmina shawls can we see from the previous
              era?
            </h2>
            <p>
              A majority of the shawls that have survived over the centuries
              belong to four different categories, namely, doshalas, patkas,
              rumals &amp; jamawars.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Doshalas</strong>: these are also known as shoulder-
              mantles.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Patkas</strong>: these are also known as sashes &amp; are
              longer &amp; narrower than doshalas.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Rumals</strong>: these are also known as the square shawls
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Jamawars</strong>: these are also known as the all-over
              designed garment pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
              The patkas &amp; doshalas, though have different dimensions, but
              their patterns are similar, each having a prominent pallas. The
              vertical border of the patka was found to be usually 1.5 times
              broader than the horizontal borders.
            </p>

              repeated along the width of the fabric; then enclosed within two
              or more horizontal &amp; vertical borders.
            </p>
            <p>
              For an entire century, from the late 17th till the late 18th
              century, the body of the shawls was left plain. Just the vertical
              border ran along the length of the shawl.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, the designs evolved, filling up the body of the
              shawl with floral motifs &amp; different patterns.

            had worn out &amp; were recycled.
          </p>
          <p>
            There would be parts from the worn-out shawls that could be
            salvaged. These parts would be incorporated into the other shawls by
            the rafugars &amp; made into completely new designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, the client would reject certain parts of the design even
            in new shawls. These rejected parts would be cut off &amp; replaced
            with a different design or pattern seamlessly to form a new design
            altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            This technique led to many shawls getting recycled &amp; many new
            patterns &amp; shapes getting formed. The notable ones amongst these
            would be the “chand-dar” or moon pattern. This was a square piece of

                6. What kind of dyes are used to color pashminas?
              </span>

            </h2>
            <p>
              In the 17th century to the mid-19th century, organic dyestuffs
              were used for a wide range of colors. The skilled dyers would use
              only five to six different substances to produce a large spectrum
              of 64 colors.
            </p>
            <p>
              The organic dyestuffs included indigo, lac &amp; kermes, logwood,
              safflower &amp; saffron for shades of blue, red, dull red &amp;
              yellow respectively. It is assumed that the large{' '}

                color palette
              </a>{' '}
              was achieved by varying the strengths of the dye &amp; also by
              combining it with different dyes
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon modern analysis, it was corroborated that all the reds &amp;
              pinks were derived from lac. The purple shades were achieved by
              combining lac with indigo in different ratios.
            </p>
            <p>
              The black dye was the only color which was inorganic. Ferrous-
              sulphate, a chemical compound, was used to achieve black color.

          </h3>
          <p>
            The 17th century dyers were very secretive about their craft &amp;
            didn’t involve outsiders in its various processes &amp; techniques.
            The craft was very well guarded &amp; kept within the families &amp;
            were only passed down through generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their skills were fascinating. They were able to produce a range of
            64 colors from the various permutation &amp; combination of merely
            5-6 substances.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the latter half of the 19th century, the aniline dyes were
            invented &amp; many shawl manufacturers started using them. These
            colors were not able to retain the softness &amp; durability of the
            Cashmere fibre &amp; were quickly discarded. This was done because
            foreign buyers refused to even look at shawls dyed using these harsh
            chemicals
