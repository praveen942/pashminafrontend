          </h2>
          <p>
            During the stark winters, with temperatures below -40° C, the
            Changthangi goats grow a thick down of very fine &amp; warm fibers
            under their coarse outer layer of fur. This fine fiber coat enables
            these goats to survive the chilly winters. This fine warm fiber,
            called “pashm” is shed by these goats during spring. It is then
            harvested by the Changpa tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pashm of the Changthangi goat is considered to be par excellence
            &amp; is the raw material used to weave Kashmiri shawls. The
            westerners, unable to pronounce Kashmir, started calling it as
            “Cashmere”. This is the origin of the 19th century use of the term
            “Cashmere”.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The factors which determine the quality of pashmina are its
            fineness, its fiber length &amp; color.
          </p>
          <p>
            The raw pashm is available in colors ranging from white, considered
            the most premium, to brown &amp; grey.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diameter of the fibre determines its fineness &amp; is measured
            in microns, i.e., 1/1000 of a millimetre. The pashm from the
            changthangi goat is between 13 to 19 microns. The suitable fibre
            length for hand weaving of “pashm” is more than 5 cms. The
            Changthangi goats that live at higher altitudes produce longer pashm
            fibre

              3. Do the silk jamawars &amp; staple jamawars cost the same?{' '}
            </span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            The silk Jamawars are far more expensive than the jamawars
            embroidered with the staple yarn. This is because of a few major
            differences between the two yarns.
          </p>
          <p>
            These differences, like the silk yarn being a natural yarn &amp;
            staple being a man- made yarn itself makes the most difference in
            price. Then there is the thickness of the two yarns. Silk is a very
            fine yarn, compared to staple yarn which is far bulkier than silk.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of this, the embroideries done using the silk yarn take
            a lot longer to complete than embroideries done using staple yarn

              4. Is Pashmina another name for Toosh or Shahtoosh?{' '}
            </span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            A lot of times, however, Pashmina gets confused with Shahtoosh, both
            of which were readily available in the previous era.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scant availability of the white toosh fibre made it more premium
            &amp; was reserved for the imperial class or the royals, earning it
            the name of shahtoosh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only are Pashmina &amp; toosh derived from different animals,
            but they are structurally very different, even though they look
            similar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Toosh is finer &amp; warmer than pashmina, with a micron count
            ranging between 9-12 microns. Whereas Pashmina ranges between 13- 19
            microns.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tibetan antelope is a wild animal, living at a height of over
            4300 meters; compared to the domesticated Changthangi goats which
            are reared at altitudes ranging from 3600-4500 meters. The higher
            altitudes &amp; lower temperatures make the animals produce finer,
            longer &amp; warmer fleece. This difference results in finer fleece
            of the Tibetan antelope.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tibetan antelope, or chiru, was mass slaughtered in the
            1960&apos;s to meet the high demand for toosh and shahtoosh shawls.
            This resulted in the addition of the Chiru in the endangered animals
            list &amp; banning in the trade of toosh items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Toosh is the fleece collected from the Tibetan antelope, also known
            as the Chiru. The toosh fiber is collected from the back &amp; other
            regions of the chiru &amp; is predominantly found in shades of
            brown. The toosh collected from the underbelly &amp; throat region
            of the chiru, however, is white in color &amp; is known as
            “shahtoosh”.

            </h2>
            <p>
              The most common weave used to weave Cashmere is the twill tapestry
              technique. This technique has many variants, forming diagonal
              lines or herringbones or the most beautiful, the
              “chashm-e-bulbul”. The “chashm-e-bulbul” forms tiny diamond shaped
              boxes on the shawl &amp; is more commonly known as the diamond
              weave. “Chashm-e-bulbul” means the eye of the bulbul bird.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though the basic twill weave is easier to weave, the diamond weave
              is more popular for plain Pashmina shawls. It adds grace &amp;
              beauty to the simple Pashmina shawl.

            The weavers use a boat shaped shuttle to weave the plain shawls.
            This shuttle is hollow in the middle &amp; houses a stick with yarn
            wrapped around it. It also has a tiny hole, or “eye” through which a
            single yarn comes out. This shuttle is moved to &amp; fro the entire
            width of the shawl.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the kani shawls however, the pre dyed yarn is wrapped onto a
            tiny stick called “kani”. The kani sticks are then used to form the
            structure as well as the colorful design on the Pashmina shawl.
          </p>
          <p>
            While a plain shawl will use only one shuttle per weft, a kani shawl
            can have numerous shuttles in every weft. The number of the kani
            sticks per weft varies according to the design to be created on the
            shawl. The more intricate the design, the more is the number of kani
            sticks &amp; the longer it takes to weave the shawl.
          </p>
          <p>
            On an average, a plain shawl can be woven in three working days;
            covering about 26- 28 inches per day. On the contrary, kani shawl
            will progress slowly, with only about 1/4th of an inch being woven
            in a day. The work done per day depends on the intricacy of the
            design

            of a kani shawl by an artisan takes over six months for completion

            Ever since Cashmere has been discovered, it had been the most

          <p>
            Pashmina, perhaps is the only craft, for which various invasions had
            been planned. Many treaties were signed to gain control over its
            trade. It had always been the soft spot of the producing regions,
            reaping the most profitable revenues.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pashm trade was shielded from any political controversy by the
            various treaties signed &amp; this resulted in the prospering of
            Kashmir’s shawl industry in the late 19th century.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sparse availability &amp; high prices, along with the
            combination of high demand &amp; banning of the toosh fibre, led to
            Pashmina becoming the most sought-after craftsmanship in the world.
