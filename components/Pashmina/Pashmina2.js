              3. What all kinds of yarns are used for embroidering on Pashmina?{' '}
            </span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Embroidery on Pashmina Shawls is done using two types of yarns. They
            may be embroidered using silk yarns, or a synthetic known as
            “staple”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The silk yarns, being very fine, give a more delicate &amp; refined
            look to the shawl. As the silk yarn is very lustrous, it imparts a
            glow to the shawl.
          </p>
          <p>
            The staple yarn, though thicker &amp; less lustrous, has the ability
            to hold its color much more than the silk yarns.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the embroidery is done, the floats at the back of the shawl
            are cut with scissors, giving it a neat look. It is due to this
            feature that even when a shawl is not intended to be double- sided,
            it is very hard to tell the difference between the front &amp; the
            back!

            <p>
              A truly hand-crafted Pashmina will feel as though you have

              utmost warmth caresses you as you nestle in it. Pashmina has a
              faintly glossy look owing to its twill tapestry weaving. It
              reflects small amounts of light &amp; giving it a luxurious
              appearance.

                Pashmina weaving
              </a>{' '}
              has always been a very laborious work. From the combing out of the
              fleece from the changthangi goats to separating individual fibres;
              then hand spinning it from fibre to yarn; then the entire weaving
              process &amp; dyeing; &amp; finally the intricate embroidery.
            </p>
            <p>
              The number of man hours put in through all these stages is
              astonishing!
            </p>
            <p>
              The combing out of the fleece of the entire changthangi goat
              livestock takes place over a few months. This fleece is a mixture
              of fine fibre, dirt, coarse hair from the outer regions of the
              goat, mixed with other organic material from the goat such as
              sweat &amp; dandruff.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next stage is the most tedious one, involving the separation
              of the fine fleece from the coarse outer hair. This hand dehairing
              of the pashm fibre is a lengthy process, with 50 gms of pashm
              taking up to 8 hours for separation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pashm wool&apos;s natural oil &amp; other impurities are then
              removed. This freshly cleaned pashm wool is then straightened by
              passing it through an upright comb.

            The Spinning Process
          </h3>
          <p>
            The spinning wheel is used for spinning the pashm to form pashmina
            yarns. This step is usually carried out by the women folk of the
            house &amp; requires a skill set that has been passed down through
            generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            For spinning, the fibre has to be manipulated as it leaves the
            spinner&apos;s fingers &amp; onto the spindle. The spun yarn is
            doubled up&amp; twisted again using the spinning wheel. It is then
            wound onto a large reel.
          </p>
          <p>
            This large reel, with the yarn wound around it is used to make hanks
            of yarn using wooden blocks with large dowels fixed into them.
          </p>
          <p>These hanks are then sent to the weavers.</p>
          <h3 className="my-4 text-left font-Orpheu  leading-[44px] leading-[44px]  text-xl lg:text-[30px] 2xl:text-3xl">
            The Weaving Process
          </h3>
          <p>
            The weavers then lay the warp using continuous lengths of yarn.
            After the required number of warp threads are set, they are lifted,
            spread &amp; smoothened out before fitting them on warp beam. The
            warp beam is detached from the loom for this purpose &amp; is
            suspended from the ceiling. The loose ends of the warp are cut &amp;
            inserted individually into the heddles. It is then fitted back into
            the loom once the warp is set &amp; given a few turns to tighten the
            warp. Only about 6-7 inches of warp are left for the weaver to start
            working on.
          </p>
          <p>
            For plain shawls, the hanks are not dyed. Rather, once the shawl is
            ready, it is then dyed in the{' '}

            , then, on consultation with the designer &amp; the weaver, the
            amount of yarn required for each color is calculated. It is then
            dyed accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dyers of pashmina have also been in their respective craft since
            generations &amp; were known to keep the secret of colors within the
            families, completely excluding outsiders from it.

          <p>
            The best quality yarn is made using the longer finer pashm fiber.
            The suitable length of fiber for hand spinning the pashm fiber into
            pashmina yarns is preferably over 5 cms. The yarn spun using the
            longer fibers are less prone to pilling. Hence, they are more sought
            after for weaving the refined yarn.

            <p>
              There are various types of embroideries adorning the Pashmina,
              adding to its value &amp; elegance. Among them, the Sozni
              Embroidery is the heart of Kashmir &amp; Pashmina alike. The other
              forms of embroideries on Pashminas include Tilla, Paper Mache and
              Kantha embroidery.

                :
              </strong>
              &nbsp;Sozni embroidery uses thin needles and silk threads or a
              “staple” yarn to create elaborate floral or paisley patterns on
              pashmina shawls and stoles. The colorful motifs are so
              meticulously embroidered that the pashmina base is barely visible.
              Sozni requires patience and hard work as a single shawl can take
              up to two to three years to complete, with master craftsman
              working on it for six hours every day.

              </a>{' '}
              are still woven today as they were many centuries ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              The very first step for making a kani shawl is to make the design
              for the shawl. The design is drawn freehand on paper first by the
              pattern drawer.
            </p>
            <p>
              After this step, a person known as the color- caller fills in the
              colors &amp; calculates the quantity the yarn has to be dyed in.
              The yarn is sent for dyeing.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the meantime, the color caller replicates the design on a graph
              paper, giving it a geometric look. This replicated design on the
              point paper is then placed under the set warp. This helps gauge
              the number of warp threads each weft has to pass through, in order
              to represent the design on the shawl.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the warp is set &amp; the yarns are colourfully dyed &amp;
              spun onto the kani sticks, the weaver proceeds to start the
              weaving process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking at the design on the point paper &amp; calculating the
              number of warp yarns the Kani stick has to pass through, the
              weaver proceeds with the weaving of the shawl. It takes at least
              6-9 months
